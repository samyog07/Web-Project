            <h4>SHERPA & SWISS ADVENTURES TEAM</h4>
            <p>Lhakpa Gyalzen Sherpa founded Sherpa & Swiss Adventures in 1993 after returning to Nepal from a year of
                work at Air Glaciers, a helicopter operator in Sion, Switzerland. At Air Glaciers he worked as a flight
                assistant and medical evacuation coordinator working side by side with Swiss mountaineers and medical
                staff. During his time in Switzerland he improved his fluency in French (in addition to Sherpa, Nepali,
                Hindi, English, and Tibetan which he already spoke) and found similarities between the Swiss
                appreciation for their mountain surroundings and his own Sherpa community. With the support and
                encouragement of his Swiss mountaineering friends he named his new company Sherpa & Swiss Adventures as
                a symbolic melding of these two mountain peoples living on opposite sides of the globe.</p>
            <p>The founder of Sherpa & Swiss Adventures, Mr. Lhakpa Gyalzen Sherpa, is a socially responsible and multi
                dynamic person who is also the founder of Easy Heli Charter Services, Manang Air (P) Ltd. and Vayodha
                Hospitals (P) Ltd. Vayodha Hospital was the first of its kind in Nepal to be designed with rooftop
                helipad which has helped to speed up the rescue mission.</p>

            <p>Lhakpa's extensive work in both the tourism industry and in mountain rescues provide him with a unique
                set of skills and experience that gives Sherpa & Swiss Adventures the ability to provide not only
                incredible Himalayan adventures to its clients but also to ensure their utmost safety. In addition to
                organizing treks, expeditions, and tours for its many clients, Sherpa & Swiss Adventures has organized
                mountain rescues and medical evacuations throughout Nepal. Lhakpa has received several awards and honors
                by grateful clients, embassies, and the mountaineering community. In 2010 he was honored by Embassies of
                Switzerland and Australia for, “skillful and outstanding management of mountain rescue operations for
                travelers in Nepal.” That same year he was awarded “Kumar Khadga Bikram Bravery Award-2009” by the Nepal
                Mountaineering Association for his work in mountain rescues. The following year he was recognized by the
                Union International Alpinists Association (UIAA) for his role in rescuing international mountaineers who
                climb Nepal’s mountains. In the year 2014 he is honoured with "Rastra Sewa samman-2014" and "Gantabya
                Nepal Publication Award".</p>
